    "### DESCRIPTION\n",
    "1. generate_random_number: This function uses random.randint to generate a random number between 1 and 100.\n",
    "2. get_user_guess: This function prompts the user for input, checks if the input is a valid integer within the range, and returns the valid guess. It continues to prompt the user until a valid input is provided.\n",
    "3. check_guess: This function compares the user's guess to the target number and prints whether the guess is \"Higher\" or \"Lower\". If the guess is correct, it prints a congratulatory message and returns True; otherwise, it returns False.\n",
    "4. play_game: This is the main function that runs the game. It generates the target number, repeatedly prompts the user for guesses, and checks each guess until the user guesses correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Input Check for Exit:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the get_user_guess function, we check if the user input is 'exit'. If it is, we return None to indicate the user wants to quit the game.\n",
    "Handle Exit in Main Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the play_game function, after calling get_user_guess, we check if the returned value is None. If it is, we print a goodbye message and break out of the loop to end the game.\n",
    "Detailed Explanation for a Beginner\n",
    "Adding the Exit Command:\n",
    "\n",
    "We prompt the user to guess a number or type 'exit' if they want to quit. If the user types 'exit', we return None from the get_user_guess function.\n",
    "Breaking the Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the play_game function, after getting a guess from the user, we check if the guess is None. If it is, this means the user typed 'exit', and we print a goodbye message and exit the loop, effectively ending the game.\n",
    "This update ensures that the user has a way to exit the game whenever they want, making the game more user-friendly.\n"
